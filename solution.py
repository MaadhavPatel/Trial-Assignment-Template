  """
  Takes a string, converts it to kebab-case, and prints it to the console.

  Kebab-case means:
  1. All characters are converted to lowercase.
  2. All spaces are replaced with a hyphen ('-').

  For example:
  - "Hello World" becomes "hello-world"
  - "Python Is Fun" becomes "python-is-fun"

  Args:
    input_string: The string to convert and print.

  # --- YOUR CODE GOES HERE ---

  # and then print the result.
